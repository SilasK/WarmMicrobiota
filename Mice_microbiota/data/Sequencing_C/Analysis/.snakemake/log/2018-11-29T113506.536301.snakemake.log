Removing output files of failed job filterLength since they might be corrupted:
figures/Lengths/Sequence_Length_distribution.pdf, figures/Lengths/Sequence_Length_distribution_abundance.pdf, output/seqtab.rds, output/seqtab.tsv
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
